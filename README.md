Official repository for TGIR! While it is inspired by [TGIK!](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tgik), there are a few notable differences:

* We do not know if there will be a live video stream - there will definitley be video content!
* While the plan is to share on a regular basis, we are starting with one-offs

The [playlist index](playlist.md) contains a list of all content.

The [official YouTube channel can be found here](https://tgir.rabbitmq.com).

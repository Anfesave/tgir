Official repository for TGIR! While it is inspired by [TGIK!](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tgik), there are a few notable differences:

* We expect most episodes to be pre-recorded, like a TV show
* The first season will have twelve episodes, one episode on the last Friday of every month
* Each episode contains all the code so that you can follow along

The [playlist index](playlist.md) contains a list of all content.

The [official YouTube channel can be found here](https://tgir.rabbitmq.com).

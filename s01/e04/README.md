This is the second part of a multi-part series on how to contribute to RabbitMQ.
Our contribution will be to submit a pull-request across multiple repositories and see it released in the next RabbitMQ patch release.

To get the best out of this episode, I encourage you to follow along and, ideally, submit a pull request to RabbitMQ.
All commands are available as make targets in this episode's directory.

- Submit little & early as WIP
- Ensure checks stay green

- Link to a dependent PR, in a dependency
- Change the PR state to done

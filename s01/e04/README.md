This is the second part on how to contribute to RabbitMQ.
We show you how to make your first RabbitMQ contribution in 3 simple steps:

1. Add a new Erlang/OTP 22 feature to [rabbitmq-prometheus](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-prometheus) in a few lines of Erlang
2. Update [Erlang-Distribution Grafana dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11352)
3. Contribute your first pull request to RabbitMQ!

We show how to link multiple contributions together, across multiple repositories:
- start with Erlang/OTP
- continue with prometheus.erl & rabbitmq-prometheus
- finish off with the Erlang-Distribution Grafana dashboard

The goal of this episode is to have you contribute this change ðŸ˜‰
